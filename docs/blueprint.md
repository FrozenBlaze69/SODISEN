## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#78A0C7) to evoke a sense of calm and reliability. This color will also ensure enough contrast against the light background.
- Background color: Light grey (#F0F4F7), a desaturated hue similar to the primary color. It is unobtrusive but professional.
- Accent color: Pale lavender (#B4A3C8) to highlight key interactive elements such as CTAs and active states; it is analogous to soft blue but provides enough differentiation to draw the eye.
- Headline font: 'Belleza' (sans-serif) for a friendly yet professional feel. Body text: 'Alegreya' (serif).
- Use clear, simple icons to represent actions and statuses.
- Prioritize a clean, intuitive layout optimized for both tablet and PC.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to provide clear feedback and enhance usability.
